          <p>
                 When You use the Service, all the conversation messages You have with the Zemedy App are private. You provide Your messages by way of 
                 choosing pre-formatted responses or by way of free-text. Each submitted message gets processed in real-time by the Zemedy App’s 
                 proprietary algorithms, and directed appropriately to subsequent context-based conversation based on a proprietary rule-based content 
                 management process. At no point during Your conversation with the Zemedy App does another natural person have access to, or gets to 
                 monitor or respond to Your messages. Your messages are not processed to send You unwanted content. Your submitted messages or app usage 
                 habits or Website browsing habits are not used to sell to advertisers. We do not ‘monetize’ the messages or the Information You submit 
                 to Us. The messages You send and receive are encrypted and stored securely.</p>
          <p> 
                 A limited set of Your conversation messages gets anonymized before being processed for internal operations and for research purposes. This i
